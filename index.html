		<h1 id="fact-sheet-list">Fact Sheet List</h1>

		<p>This site is intended to provide an expansive and organized meta-compilation of high-quality factsheets, documents, resources, essays, and links supporting a broadly <strong>progressive</strong> worldview.</p>

		<p>If you have a resource you believe would be a good addition, or you would like to make any suggestion at all really, please shoot me a DM on Discord at <strong>SoopaKhell#0094</strong>.</p>

		<p>Try to recommend <em>compilations</em> of sources. If a provided resource is only one source (i.e. is just one study) or it is unlikely to be particularly useful in a debate (i.e. it is only intended to educate, not primarily intended to debunk or prove a claim) it probably does not qualify for the list. If you are unsure, send it to me anyways.</p>

		<p>While the order these factsheets are presented in is not particularly important, it generally follows the rule of “higher up in the category = more useful or higher quality”.</p>

		<p>All of the links that end in “/mobilebasic” can be replaced with “/edit” to access the google docs/sheets version, allowing you to make a copy of it on your own account.</p>

		<p>This list used to be hosted at <a href="http://www.soopakhell.xyz/">soopakhell.xyz</a>. The site has moved, please use <a href="http://www.factsheetlist.xyz/">factsheetlist.xyz</a> (the site you're on right now) from now on.</p>

		<p>Keep in mind: <strong>I cannot speak to the veracity of all the information presented here. Don’t be surprised if some of the studies/papers presented in these links were retracted by their authors, have serious methodological flaws, or are generally low-quality. Just know you have been warned.</strong></p>

		<p>In the event that this website dies, you can access several saved versions (alongside all pages linked here) on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.factsheetlist.xyz/">Wayback Machine</a>.</p>
